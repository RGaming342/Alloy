## ⚠️ WARNING: This is not the final description but the old plans for Zult ⚠️

# Zult

### Purpose
Zult is a highly configurable programming language designed for both low-level development, such as operating system and game engine development, and high-level development, like web development and scripting. 

### Target Audience
Zult is designed for everyone, from beginners to experienced developers, offering versatility and performance.

### Key Features
- **Static Typing**: Ensures type safety and reliability.
- **Execution Paradigms**: Primarily procedural, with support for functional and object-oriented programming.
- **Performance Focus**: Optimized for high performance, making it suitable for demanding applications.
- **Similarity to C, C++, and Rust**: Familiar syntax and concepts, easing the learning curve for developers with experience in these languages.
- **Metaprogramming Capabilities**: Includes macros for advanced code manipulation.
- **C Library Compatibility**: Ability to use existing C libraries seamlessly.

### Development Status
Zult is in the very early stages of development.


### Syntax Interpretation Phase (SIP), (an idea from old ignorent me)
The Syntax Interpretation Phase (SIP) is a planned feature that will allow syntax customization, enabling the language to mimic other languages or create custom syntax. This feature is a long way from being started in development and represents a future direction for Zult.

Zult is short for Zultanite, a type of gem.
